# NvEZOSv1
Release V1

Coming soon, do not download anything in this repo until this is updated.

V1.01 Code currently undergoing final verification.

Fix List -
1) Resolved issue where system was able to be initialized before install of all components completed resulting in several critical components (primarilly ssh) not being installed.
2) Now using nvidia-384 driver, in testing tends to be more stable, less issues with overclock - hashrates appear to be the same.
3) Resolved cuda dependency that was causing some installs to hang.
